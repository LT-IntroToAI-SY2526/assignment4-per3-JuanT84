# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part of tic-tac-toe was the make move function. The structure of this piece of code really confused me. I was able to set up the if statement but was confused on how to actually place the X's and O's. I initially struggled with the parameters but I eventually figured it out.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

    I would create a new function and figure out how to randomize and set it up so it will randomize different positions and play against the player. I would probably find a way to insert different sequences that could win for a hard matchup.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

    I would insert certain patterns or strategies. I would add if statements such as if player is at 2 then move to a certain pattern that could beat the moves. I would add a list of win patterns and if statements based on the players potential moves.
